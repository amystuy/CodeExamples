# CodeExamples
A collection of code examples for Merit review, requested by Jason Russell on 5/13/2020.

This repository includes scripts in R, Python, and C++. I primarily authored all scripts, with the exception of the python script  'DataDrivenPages' which was a collaborative effort with two other individuals. I have included the following:
  -- 4 python scripts that automate manual GIS functions, improving my workflow efficiency 
  -- 2 R scripts that import, organize, manipulate, and analyze datasets (csvs as well as rasters)
  -- 2 C++ scripts from my undergrad coursework in the Computer Science department
